# BlackJack Project

This game is a famous card game, **Black Jack**. Play it on local computer.

# How to play !?

My project is a java project, so for now you need to have java installed on your computer to launch the App.java file.
I was trying to zipping the project into a jar file but I got some bugs that the game can't display the gameplay.

# Gameplay: 
The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.

In Blackjack, in a given round, the player's ultimate goal is to get a hand that's higher than the dealer's (without being higher than 21, or 'busting'). Only by beating the dealer can a player win their bet. Players determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards.
+ 2 through 10: The number listed on the card (e.g., 2 is worth 2 points).
Jack, Queen, King: 10 points
+ Ace: 1 or 11 points (the player gets to choose)
+ An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as a Blackjack.

Each win round will gives you 10 point; otherwise, each lose round will takes you 10 points
